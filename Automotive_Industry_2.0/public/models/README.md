# 3D Car Model

The application expects the Honda NSX model to be located here:
`/public/models/2020_honda_nsx_na1_lbworks/scene.gltf`

To install the model:

1. Locate the `2020_honda_nsx_na1_lbworks` folder in your project root or `Automotive_Industry_2.0` directory.
2. Move or copy that entire folder into `Automotive_Industry_2.0/public/models/`.

Structure should be:
```
Automotive_Industry_2.0/
  public/
    models/
      2020_honda_nsx_na1_lbworks/
        scene.gltf
        scene.bin
        textures/
```

If the model is missing, the application may crash or show nothing.
